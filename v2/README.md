# newMask

## Details

* This design allows for a larger filter to be used on the mask, which provides essential air flow to the wearer.

* Has a flair on the edge to better accommodate some form of gasket.

* There is an "S" and "L" on the side of each mask for sizing. Both sizes use the same filter and retaining ring size.

* It's not the smoothest model, so if you’re good at that and would like to help me, thank you.

* Not exactly the fastest, and doesn’t save much filament. Remember I was going for passing specifications, and not for efficiency.
